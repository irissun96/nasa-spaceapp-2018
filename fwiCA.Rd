\title{Fire weather index data from observations and reanalysis at 7 locations in Spain}
\format{A list of two elements, containing data of the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis and observations data respectively. 
For each element of the list, a second list of length 7 is provided, each corresponding to a particular location in Spain,
 each of them containing a dataframe with the following fields:
 \itemize{
 \item \code{fecha}. A vector of class Date with dates of the records
 \item \code{T} A numeric vector of temperature records, in degree C
 \item \code{H} A numeric vector of relative hunidity records, in degree \%
 \item \code{P} A numeric vector of precipitation records, in mm, see details
 \item \code{W} A numeric vector of wind speed records, in km/h
 \item \code{FWI} A numeric vector with the Fire Weather Index series 
 }
 @details Data correspond both to observations from the Spanish Meteorological Agency (AEMET, all recorded 
 at noon excepting precipitation, recorded at 07:00 UTC and corresponding to values
  accumulated during the last 24h) and the NCEP reanalysis interpolated to the same locations (12:00 UTC), 
  encompassing a period of approximately 6 years (2006-2011). These records are therefore appropriate for the 
  calculation of several fire danger indices, requiring data measured around noon.
   Further details on this dataset are provided in Bedia \emph{et al.} (2012).}
\description{
Temperature, relative humidity, precipitation and wind velocity data from 7 locations in Spain,
 as well as the resulting Fire Weather Index series, corresponding to both weather station observations
  and reanalysis data (NCEP).
